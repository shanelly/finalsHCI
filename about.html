										<h3>Who am I anyway?</h3>
										<p>
											Actually I am just an oridnary schoolgirl just wanting to share my travel pictures to anyone. It doesn't really matter to me if anyone sees this, It just really feels good to me to just put my photos out there.It gives me a time to reflect and relive all those wonderfulmoments and just appreciate the beauty of the world and how thankful Iam to be able to visit some places inside or outside th country. One of my goals in  life is to be able to travel all around the world and experience traveling alone, cause that would so much an adventure!

										<h3>My Travel Buddies</h3>
										<p>
											My favorite travel buddies are absolutely my family. I love them to death! Me and my siblings all have the desire to get our monies worth and not to waste any of our time. We make every second worth it. We think that everytime we travel, we become zombies! We sleep for only little hours, and start our day early. We love taking pictures and trying different things all together. I couldn't ask for better travel buddies.
